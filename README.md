# U8 - Umbraco V8 UI kit

**WORK IN PROGRESS** - be nice!


## What's it for?

* To make it easy to construct mockups of the Umbraco backoffice
* Useful to quickly mock up interface ideas for **packages**, **content apps** or **property/data editors**
* Useful for UX/UI people to produce mockups of potential changes or improvements to the backoffice **look and feel** or **functionality**
* A starting point for documenting the different components and their usage across the backoffice, in order to identify inconsistencies in usage and patterns


## What's it's not for

* At this stage, I'm not trying to incorporate every state of every screen, component and dialog in the backoffice.
* The focus (at the moment) is very much on providing building blocks that help people to mock up examples of backoffice UI.


## Sketch and Abstract

* The actual UI kit files are **[Sketch](https://www.sketch.com)** files
* Sketch files can also be opened in [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html) and imported into [Figma](https://www.figma.com), but I expect some issues - needs testing!
* I'm using **[Abstract](https://www.abstract.com)** to manage version control - it's essentially Git for Sketch files, allowing branching, merging, annotation and collaboration etc. - Abstract is the tool that will turn this from a personal project into a community project.


## Sign up for access to the Abstract project

* To join the live Abstract project, [sign up here for a Guest Viewer account](https://app.goabstract.com/invitations/0ffb4ad2fa537a525320852cb403b755e8a1498544c0c6eb8c5c28e1bb406ced)
* There's a web interface that lets you view, inspect and comment/annotate on everything, but you'll need a the Abstract desktop app for Mac to export the files to your machine.


## So, what is this repository for?

* I've created this repository outside the Abstract workflow, so that people who aren't on Mac, or don't use Sketch, have somewhere they can grab the files from the master branch.
* Every time I merge changes into the master branch, I'll try to remember to update the files on this repo too - the commit reference is in the folder/file name, so it should be easy to tell which version you're using.


## Challenges

* **Finding the time!** I started this project a couple of months ago, and then, almost immediately, got super-busy at work, so it's not moved forwards as quickly as I'd hoped.
* **Taxonomy and structure** - I'm trying to build a hierarchy of atomic components where the structure and naming system makes sense. I suspect that I'll need to go through the whole thing with a hierarchy that isn't quite right, and then refactor the structure once there's a clear big picture.


## How can you contribute?

* [Sign up for a Guest Viewer account](https://app.goabstract.com/invitations/0ffb4ad2fa537a525320852cb403b755e8a1498544c0c6eb8c5c28e1bb406ced) and comment, annotate, suggest things.
* If GitHub is more your thing, then feel free to add issues here too.
* Suggest screens and components that you think need to be incorporated that haven't, and prioritise those.
* Suggest improvements to the taxonomy and hierarchy that will make it a smoother process to extend and update.
* **All help, input and feedback is welcome!**


Cheers!
